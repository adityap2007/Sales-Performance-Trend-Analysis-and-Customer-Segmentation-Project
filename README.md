# Sales-Performance-Trend-Analysis-and-Customer-Segementation-Project
Analyzed e-commerce sales data using Python (Pandas/Seaborn). Applied EDA and time series to find sales trends. The core method was RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to categorize customers. Delivered actionable insights identifying high-value and at-risk segments for targeted marketing and retention strategies.

1. Monthly Sales Trend (monthly_sales_trend.png)
What it Shows: This is a Line Chart that plots the total revenue generated by the e-commerce business over the entire period captured in the data (typically late 2010 to late 2011).

Interpretation:

The primary insight is Seasonality. You will likely observe a significant increase in sales toward the end of the year, culminating in a sharp peak, usually in November. This is crucial for businesses as it justifies spending more on inventory and marketing during that month.

The line helps identify the overall growth or decline trend. If the line generally slopes up over the observed time, the business is growing.

The sharp drop in December (and usually a very low starting point in January) is a common retail pattern following the holiday shopping season.

Relevance: This is used by finance and operations teams for forecasting and budgeting.
